# Business-Analytics-Nanodegree

This repository contains the projects required for graduation from the Business Analytics Nanodegree program by Udacity.

The first project was a simple report that includes insights about the Malaria in Kenya dashborad.

The second project was analyzing real life data from the New York Stock Exchange dataset provided by Kaggle. The main goal of this project was to interpret the measures of central tendency and spread (mean, median, standard deviation, range), use a combination of Excel functions (e.g., IF statements, INDEX and MATCH, calculating descriptive statistics with the IF statement, drop downs, data validation, VLOOKUP), analyze and forecast financial business metrics,, create visualizations of a business metric, and use Excel to create a financial forecast model.

The third project was querying the Chinook Database. The Chinook Database holds information about a music store. I used SQL to retrive information from the database to create my insights and report.

The fourth project was creating visualizations to reveal insights from the flight delays and cancellation in the US in 2015 data set. I have analyzed the dataset and thought about four questions to build my dashboard and stories on.
